``componentDidMount`` methods will execute in the order grandchild - child - parent, whereas ``componentWillMount`` methods will execute the other way around. I found this knowledge useful when I transitioned a codebase from Marionette.js to React.js, and kept Marionette's global messaging system so that components could listen to it and updated themselves (since many of the props were objects, changing them internally didn't trigger an update).
